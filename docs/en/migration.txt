Migration
=========

A migration in Baleen is a class that implements ``MigrationInterface``. It can optionally implement one or more
additional interfaces to describe special *capabilities*.

MigrationInterface
------------------

All :term:`migration` classes must implement ``MigrationInterface``, which declares the ``up()`` and ``down()`` methods.
Each of those methods should modify the :term:`target resource` symmetrically:

    * UP: Describes what happens when the resource moves up (or forwards) in the Timeline.
    * DOWN: Describes how to revert / rollback the resource if ``up`` has already been executed.

The following snippet illustrates a simple migration that creates (or destroys) a table. Note how the up and down
methods are perfectly symmetrical to each other:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class v001_AddHireDateToStaff extends MigrationInterface
    {

        // a constructor would go here to set up the connection

        /**
          * Adds a "hire_date" column to the staff table.
          */
        public function up() {
            $this->connection->exec("ALTER TABLE staff ADD hire_date date");
        }

        /**
          * Removes the "hire_date" column from the staff table.
          */
        public function down() {
            $this->connection->exec("ALTER TABLE staff REMOVE hire_date date");
        }
    }

Additional Capabilities
------------------------

Additional interfaces can be used to indicate special features available for a certain migration. Baleen supplies a few
common interfaces for commonly-used features, but more can be created to suit specific needs.

OptionsAwareInterface
######################

A migration that implements this interface must receive an ``Options`` object after being
instantiated. The ``Options`` object will include contextual information that could be useful for the migration. Refer
to the ``Options`` class documentation for more information.

TransactionAwareInterface
#########################

A migration that implements this interface must implement a set of methods that will aid in generating transactions.
Useful for example to wrap ``up()`` or ``down()`` commands into database transactions. The methods declared in this
interface are:

    * ``begin()``: called right before executing the migration (i.e. the ``up()`` or ``down()`` method).
    * ``finish()``: called right after the migration finished executing without any exceptions.
    * ``abort(Exception)``: called if any exception is fired during the execution of the migration. The exception is
      passed as the only parameter. The ``abort`` method must recover the resource from the exception (e.g. roll-back
      the transaction) and optionally re-throw the exception if needed.

Other Capabilities
##################

Additional interfaces can be specified to deal with special features required by any particular migration process. In
order to make this easy to customise, migrations are run through a configurable *Command Bus* pattern.

Example Migrations
------------------

For the purposes of this example, imagine the following classes are each located on a separate file under a folder in
your project called ``./migrations``.

The first file declares a sample abstract class to incorporate common functionality. It is of course up to the user
whether something like this is really required or not.

File ``./migrations/AbstractPDOMigration.php`` :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Baleen\Migration\MigrationInterface;
    use Baleen\Migration\Capabilities;
    use Baleen\Migration\MigrationInterface;
    use Baleen\Migration\RunOptions;

    /**
     * You can be as creative as you want here. The only requirement is to implement
     * MigrationInterface.
     */
    class AbstractPDOMigration
        implements MigrationInterface,
                   Capabilities/OptionsAwareInterface,
                   Capabilities/TransactionAwareInterface
    {
        /** @var PDO **/
        protected $connection; // gets initialised on the constructor

        /** @var RunOptions **/
        protected $options;

        public function __construct (PDO $connection) {
            $this->connection = $connection;
        }

        public function begin() {
            $this->connection->beginTransaction();
        }

        public function finish() {
            $this->connection->commit();
        }

        public function abort() {
            $this->connection->rollBack();
        }

        public function setOptions(RunOptions $options) {
            $this->options = $options;
        }
    }

And now the concrete migrations:

File ``./migrations/v001_AddHireDateToStaff.php`` :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class v001_AddHireDateToStaff extends AbstractPDOMigration
    {
        public function up() {
            $this->connection->exec("ALTER TABLE staff ADD hire_date date");
        }

        public function down() {
            $this->connection->exec("ALTER TABLE staff ADD hire_date date");
        }
    }

File ``./migrations/v002_SeedJoeBloggs.php`` :

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class v002_SeedJoeBloggs extends AbstractPDOMigration
    {
        public function up() {
            $this->connection->exec(
                "INSERT INTO staff (id, first, last) VALUES (23, 'Joe', 'Bloggs')"
            );
        }

        public function down() {
            $this->connection->exec("DELETE FROM staff WHERE id = 23");
        }
    }

    // ... etc - for the purposes of this example imagine there are 100 migrations
